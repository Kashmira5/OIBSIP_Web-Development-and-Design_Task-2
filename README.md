# Task 2: Tribute Page for someone I admire (SamDoesArts)

## Objective  
Write about what you adore in the person, add images, give an appealing layout, use paragraphs appropriately. You can also play around with different font styles and background colors. I showcased the digital artist Sam Yang (SamDoesArts) — reflecting his art style, with subtle animations, bento box artwork gallery and colourful theme.

## Steps Performed  
- Set up structure: hero section, about section, artworks section and footer.  
- Applied pastel colour palette throughout, and animations (smooth scroll, hover, rotate) to make the page engaging.  
- Added JavaScript for micro-interactions.  

## Tools Used  
- HTML5  
- CSS3 (animations, transitions, Grid/Flex)  
- JavaScript for hover/micro-interactions.

## Outcome  
An interactive and engaging web page showcasing the artist’s style and work.
